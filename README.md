Effects of different Classification models on Dow Jones index (2011).

The project has been realized within the course in Business Intelligence at University of Siena. The aim of the project is realizing a Machine Learning algorithm for forecasting the right choose in sell/buy operations. In particular, I tried to figure out the effects of two different Classification approaches on a dataset composed by stock price data, collected over the first six months of the 2011. Together with the R scripts utilized, I reported in different files the previous works done on the same dataset, techniques, results and other useful informations.
